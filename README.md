# Meta-evaluate a new metric on CNN/DM
## I can score all the given summaries 
1. Just give a scores dict in the below format. Make sure to include ``litepyramid_recall``, which is the metric used by human evaluators, in the scores dict.
2. Run [the analysis notebook](https://github.com/neulab/REALSumm/blob/master/analysis/analysis.ipynb) on the scores dict to get all the graphs and tables used in the paper.

## Help me score the given summaries
1. Update ``scorer.py`` such that (1) if there is any setup required by your metric, make sure to do it in the ``__init__`` function of scorere as the scorere will be used to score all systems. And (2) add your metric in the ``score`` function as
```python
elif self.metric == "name_of_my_new_metric":
  scores = call_to_my_function_which_gives_scores(passing_appropriate_arguments)
```

where ``scores`` is a list of scores corresponding to each summary in a file. It should be a list of dictionaries e.g. ``[{'precision': 0.0, 'recall': 1.0} ...]``


2. Calculate the scores and the scores dict using ``python get_scores.py --data_path ../selected_docs_for_human_eval/<abs or ext> --output_path ../score_dicts/abs_new_metric.pkl --log_path ../logs/scores.log -n_jobs 1 --metric <name of metric> ``
3. Your scores dict is generated at the output path.
4. Merge it with the scores dict with human scores provided in ``scores_dicts/`` using ``python score_dict_update.py --in_path <score dicts folder with the dicts to merge> --out_path <output path to place the merged dict pickle> -action merge``
5. Your dict will be merged with the one with human scores and the output will be placed in ``out_path``. You can now run the analysis notebook on the scores dict to get all the graphs and tables
